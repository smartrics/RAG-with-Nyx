# What is Nyx

[Nyx](https://www.get-nyx.io/) is a cutting-edge technology designed for efficient data discovery and retrieval, tailored to address one of the most pressing challenges in AI adoption: providing secure and trusted domain-specific knowledge that offers meaningful context to user queries.

## Key Features of Nyx

1. Decentralised Exchange
    - Nyx operates on a **decentralised architecture**, ensuring **data sovereignty**. This allows organisations to retain full control over their data while benefiting from shared ecosystems.
    - The Exchange acts as a **trusted-less** layer for **connecting data producers and consumers** securely and efficiently.
2. Built for AI Workflows
    - Nyx provides the foundational infrastructure to support **AI workflows**, enabling seamless integration of domain-specific knowledge into AI applications.
    - It enhances **contextual understanding** by retrieving and curating the most relevant and trusted datasets, empowering AI models with better insights.
3. Formal Semantic Metadata
    - Nyx employs **formal semantics** (ontologies) to model metadata, enriching datasets and enabling powerful retrieval and context delivery for AI applications:
    - **Metadata** is machine-readable, standardised, and aligned with semantic web technologies, improving interoperability across domains.
    - Advanced semantic annotations support:
        - **Enhanced discovery**: By leveraging deep relationships and attributes rather than simple keywords, Nyx enables sophisticated queries to identify relevant datasets.
        - **Contextual enrichment**: Enriched metadata provides additional context to AI workflows, ensuring alignment with specific use cases, improving accuracy, and reducing errors.
4. Metadata for Governance
Nyx extends the use of metadata beyond discovery to include governance, ensuring datasets are compliant, traceable, and reliable:
    - **Provenance**: Tracks the origin and history of data to ensure trustworthiness and accountability.
    - **Access Control**: Supports fine-grained permissions for secure and controlled access to data.
    - **Licensing and Usage Rights**: Manages licensing terms and usage policies, ensuring datasets are used appropriately and legally.
    - **Data Quality**: Captures data quality metrics to help users select high-quality datasets for their workflows.
    - **Schema and Structure Descriptions**: Provides detailed descriptions of data schemas and structures, enabling seamless integration with AI workflows and reducing preprocessing requirements.
5. Pipeline Integration
    - Nyx **connects** data producers (sources of raw or enriched data) with data consumers (AI models or workflows) via pipelines.
    - These pipelines:
        - Enrich datasets with governance-driven semantic metadata.
        - Shape and prepare data for AI applications, reducing preprocessing overhead.
6. User-Friendly Tools
    - Nyx offers an **intuitive UI** and developer-friendly SDK, empowering both technical and non-technical users to create workflows.
    - These tools simplify metadata management, pipeline creation, and integration with existing AI infrastructure.
